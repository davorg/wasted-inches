Beckham has hurt his foot (again? didn’t we cover this just a few days ago?)
and this apparently means that England won’t do very well in the World Cup. Of
course this really shouldn't be seen as the tabloids lining up excuses in
advance knowing that England never do well in the World Cup. And anyway why do
they give such importance to football? Does anyone really care what happens?

And we're talking about Beckham’s foot again. At this point it's about six
weeks until the competition starts and (now that the Queen Mother has been
buried) the tabloids can talk of little else. Of course, my question "does
anyone really care what happens?" was a little naïve. There are plenty of
people who care deeply what happens in the World Cup. A better question would
have been "why?"
