Apparently David Beckham has said that he would be willing to cheat if it
would help England win some forthcoming football match against Argentina. It
seems that one of the Argentinian players did something similar the last time
they played so he sees it as poetic justice. We, of course, can't understand
why anyone would get so excited about a football match that they think it's
important enough to cheat to win it.

Ten years on and the tensions between the UK and Argentina over Falkland
Island (aka The Malvinas) still dominate any sporting clashes between the two
countries. Only last month there was furore across the tabloids as the
Argentine Olympic team filmed a promotional video in Port Stanley.
