Mid-week sales indicate that Gareth Gates' single is out-selling Will Young's
and that Gareth will be number one when the new chart is announced on Sunday.

Although Will is (apparently) gay and Gareth is a member of a church that
(allegedly) hates gays, they are still the best of friends and many of todayâ€™s
papers carry a space-wasting photo of Will congratulating Gareth. Wasting space
on reporting who is number one is, of course, pointless. Wasting space
speculating on who might be number one in a few days time is just taking the
piss.

The tabloids continued to try and manufacture competition between
[Will Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Young) and
[Gareth Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Gates). And their
publicity machines continued to find excuses to show what good mates they
were. Tabloids still print stories like this on a particularly slow news day.
Or if a vaguely interesting record looks like it might beat the
[X Factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X_Factor_(UK)) winner to
the Christmas number one spot.
