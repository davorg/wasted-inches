Ever since Home Secretary David Blunkett announced last week that cannabis
will be reclassified from class B to class C, the *Daily Mail* has been
running a campaign to make him reconsider. Every day they have been running
headlines on how terrible life is in areas of Lambeth where “drugs usage is
rife”. They completely ignore the fact that most of the crime surrounding
drugs is caused purely because they are illegal. Today's headline is really
scraping the bottom of the barrel. They have a photo of three or four people
enjoying a joint in a sunny park. An innocuous enough sight you might think –
but not to the *Daily Mail* as only yards away children play
innocently unaware of the fiends in their midst. It's all total nonsense,
of course.

And here's something that doesn't change. Both politicians and the tabloids
still have a knee-jerk reaction to drugs which make it impossible to have an
intelligent conversation on the subject. In the ten years since I wrote this
entry, cannabis has been reclassified back to class B and the government have
sacked a scientific adviser on drugs because he insisted on giving them
scientific evidence on drugs.
