That’s "Kylie is Single", not "New single from Kylie". It seems that Kylie has
split up with her boyfriend (can’t remember his name – but it’s not important,
he’s a nobody). Why are all the tabloids telling us this on a day when the BNP
are winning council seats?

Another day, another pointless story about a
[pop singer's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylie_Minogue) love
life. History has failed to record who this particular ex-boyfriend was. More
happily, ten years on from this story, the
[BNP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_National_Party) lost
pretty much all of its councillors.
