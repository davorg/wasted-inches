Obviously vitally important stuff here people, as it’s all over the front page
of today’s *Soaraway Sun*. Apparently Posh (hah! have you heard her
speak?) and Becks are spending a quarter of a million on a party for the
England football team. Aren't you glad you;re not invited? Imagine how bored
you'd get at a party where all the guests were either footballers or Spice
Girls.

Football (in particular the
[FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup">World Cup)) was
going to become bit of an obsession on Wasted Inches and this was its first
mention. This story could easily be written today.

[The Beckhams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beckhams">The Beckhams)
are still standard tabloid fodder. And the tabloids’ coverage of the England
World Cup team gets more offensively jingoistic every time the competition
comes around. Of course, the other four
[Spice Girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice_Girls) have largely
been forgotten.
