Beppe is a character in Eastenders which is an extremely tedious soap opera so
presumably they aren't talking about "Beppe" but the actor who plays him. The
opinions of an actor about a program he acts in should, of course, be a matter
of supreme disinterest to the newspapers, but in this case it's obviously
important enough to knock even Beckham's foot off the front page.

I have no memory at all of who "Beppe" was or who played him. But he was
obviously very important to the tabloids ten years ago.
