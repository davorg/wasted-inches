The *Sun* still believe that this morning's most important news is
tomorrow's football match. Of course, other than a bit of team news there's
actually nothing to say about the match, so their story just consists of
jingoistic exhortations for the team to do their best. What a waste of
newsprint. And tomorrow's front page will, no doubt, be more of the same.
Imagine how bad it'll get if the team go even further in the competition.

Ten years on and nothing has changed. You only need to look at the coverage of
Euro 2012 to see that.
