Can someone please explain to me why it's news that two grown adults are (or
maybe aren't) having an affair. It's been on the front pages for days now and
itâ€™s just very boring.

Even ten years on, I still don't understand why this story was so important.
A [TV presenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulrika_Jonsson) has an affair
with a [football manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sven-G%C3%B6ran_Eriksson).
Why would anyone possibly care?
