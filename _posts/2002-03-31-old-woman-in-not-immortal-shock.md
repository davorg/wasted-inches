We're not completely heartless here at ***Wasted Inches***.
We realise that the death of a member of the Royal family is a legitimate news
story. But don't you think that today's hagiographies are taking it all a bit
too far?

This is a bit of a strange one. As we'll see over the next few days, I think
the tabloids rather misjudged public feeling here. The general public didn't
seem to be quite as interested in the Queen Mother's death as the tabloids
thought they should be.
