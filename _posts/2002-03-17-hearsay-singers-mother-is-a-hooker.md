The singers (and I use the word in a very loose sense) from Hear'Say are all
completely uninteresting. Their families are even less interesting (if that is
possible). Why then did today's *News of the World* think that it was
worth telling the world that one of their mothers is (or maybe was) a hooker.
It must have been a really slow news day in tabloid land. I think they said it
was Danny’s mother. He’s the one who looks a bit like a potato.

[Hear'Say](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hear%27Say) had won
[*Pop Stars*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popstars_(UK_series_1))
in 2001.

By March 2002 their career was very much on the wane. By the end of the year,
they had split up.

* [Myleene Klass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myleene_Klass) went back to
classical music and then became a TV presenter.
* [Kim Marsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kym_Marsh) and
[Suzanne Shaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Shaw) both ended up acting
in soaps.
* [Noel Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Sullivan) and
[Danny Foster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Foster_(musician))
both pretty much vanished without trace.

I remember being really quite pleased with the “a bit like a potato”.
