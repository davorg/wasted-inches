Was anyone really surprised that Will Young came out as gay? If you were
surprised, have you ever watched Pop Idol? Didnâ€™t you see Will and Gareth
singing "The Long and Winding Road" to each other?

[Will Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Young) had won
[Pop Idol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_Idol) in February 2002,
beating the favourite [Gareth Gates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Gates)
in the final. Very few people were surprised to hear that Will was gay. Many
people were very surprised when, some time later, Gareth came out as straight
and admitted that he had lost his virginity to
[Katie Price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_(Katie_Price)).
