The only sport that we at ***Wasted Inches*** hate more than football is
boxing. It's amazing that a sport like that is even legal. It's very galling,
therefore, to see that every tabloidÂ front page today is about two grown men
being paid obscene amounts of money to beat each other up. And we call
ourselves civilised.

I have no idea at all who the two men were or what the bout was about. I do
know, however, that the tabloids' love affair with boxing doesn't seem to have
diminished one bit. It's appalling.
