Classic example of misdirection in this headline from today’s
*Soaraway Sun*. It appears with a picture of spikey-haired homophobe
and pop idol Gareth Gates standing next to Big Brother winner and general
waste of space Kate Lawler. We’re obviously supposed to infer that they are
getting engaged, but further reading reveals that in fact they’ve just
exchanged phone numbers (so they can give each other "a ring" – geddit!)
If we were feeling particularly cynical we might point out that Gareth has
a new single out on Monday and that the BB3 video has just been released so
this *could* all be a big publicity stunt. But, of course, the
*Sun* is a serious newspaper that would never allow its front page to
be used like that.

Ten years on and the frantic publicity attempts of Gates and Lawler were all
for nothing. It’s years since I heard anything about either of them.
