The singers (and I use the word in a very loose sense) from Hear'Say are all
completely uninteresting. Their families are even less interesting (if that is
possible). Why then did today's <em>News of the World</em> think that it was
worth telling the world that one of their mothers is (or maybe was) a hooker.
It must have been a really slow news day in tabloid land. I think they said it
was Danny’s mother. He’s the one who looks a bit like a potato.

By the end of the year, they had split up.

with the “a bit like a potato”.
