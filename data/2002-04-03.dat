The front page of today’s Mirror has a photo showing the (almost non-existent)
queue of people waiting to sign the books of condolence for “the people’s
granny”. They also run a leader bemoaning the fact that no-one seems to care.
We see this as evidence that we’re right. The general public really isn’t
interested in half of the “news” that the tabloids publish.

commentary:
A few days after the Queen Mother died and the general public still showed no
sign of being anywhere near as interested as the tabloids thought they should
be.
