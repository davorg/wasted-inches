Big Brother still isn't news, but most of the tabloids continue to act like it
is. In particular <em>The Star</em> has had a Big Brother story on its front
page just about every day for the last two weeks. Here's how it works. The
<em>Star</em> hacks watch out for news the from the show and blow it up out
of all proportion. Today's headline is a great example. They claim that Jade
is pregnant.

Their evidence for this seems to boils down to the fact that she's a bit porky
and she eats a lot. Now I know that Jade isn't the brightest kid on the block,
but I strongly suspect she would have picked up on some other clues if she
was really pregnant.

commentary:
This shows one big change in the last ten years. No-one cares about Big Brother
at all any more. Channel 4 realised that and they very sensibly killed itÂ off
a couple of years ago. Channel 5 have been broadcasting it since then. It's
running currently but I couldn't name one of the housemates. I haven't seen a
single front-page headline about it this year. Of course, there are other
reality TV shows that grab the headlines instead. As far as I can see, that's
mainly the talent shows.
