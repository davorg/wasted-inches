We’re getting pretty immune to the constant stories about the world cup, but
we were particularly impressed with the hyperbole on the front page of today’s
<em>Soaraway Sun</em>. Apparently the <em>whole</em> of the UK will be up
early tomorrow to watch another England game. Sorry to disappoint them but we
know of a number of people who would rather stay in bed.

This doesn’t change. Tabloids still routinely lie about the number of people
who are interested in the stories they peddle. We’ve seen this recently with
the Diamond Jubilee (the whole country celebrated the Queen’s reign) and no
doubt there will be plenty of similar stories based on Euro 2012 which started
over the weekend (everyone will be cheering on England). In reality, the TV
viewing figures tell a completely different story. I’ll admit that a large
proportion of the population will watch this stuff. But it’s nowhere near
“everyone”.
