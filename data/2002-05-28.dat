The Sport has a great way to fill its front page when its journalists are
feeling particularly lazy (which seems to be just about all the time). They
surf the web for a while looking for fake photos of some young starlet. When
they find them, they print them on the front page with a story saying how
terrible it is that photos like this can appear on the internet. I don’t think
they can spell “hypocritical” – let alone understand what it means! Today it’s
the turn of Britney Spears. They’ve found a fake that has her body attached to
a large-breasted entrant from some “wet t-shirt” competition. Of course, the
headline forgets to mention that the photo is a fake. You only learn that when
you bother to read the dozen or so words that constitute the “story” under
the photo.

commentary:
I haven’t been looking all that closely, but I don’t think we see many stories
like this any more. I think that’s largely because even the readers of the
lower end tabloids are so used to the internet that no-one is the slightest
bit surprised when they come across pictures like these. Mind you, the Mail
still likes to run “ban this sick filth” stories that are illustrated with
photos which leave you in no doubt exactly how sick the filth is.
