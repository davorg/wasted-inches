The story of Beckham’s foot rumbles on. Today both the Mirror and the Sun have
a photo of a foot taking up the front page. I guess it’s supposed to be the
broken “Miracle Foot”, but there’s really no way to be sure that it is. I’m
starting to wish that another royal would die – to keep this nonsense of the
front pages.

commentary:
Another day, another sea of front pages covered in photographs of a
footballer’s foot. What a waste of space.
