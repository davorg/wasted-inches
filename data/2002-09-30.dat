There are some big stories around today – the opening of the Labour Party
Conference and the US still trying to find a good excuse to attack Iraq are
two good examples. But all of the tabloids ignore all of that and present us
with news that would have been pointless even when it was current (in the
mid 1980s). Anyone would think the editors are being told what to print by
the Labour Party spin doctors in order to minimise the amount of coverage
that the Party Conference is getting.

commentary:
This was the story about Edwina Currie and John Major. Ten years on, I still
don’t want to think about that.

And at that point, Wasted Inches finishes. I can’t remember why I stopped it.
I know I’d started <a href="http://blog.dave.org.uk/">another blog</a> which
became the main place where I wrote. But it never really covered the tabloids
in the way that Wasted Inches did. These days, of course, we have many
excellent blogs which spend their time pointing out the nonsense that the
tabloids print. I hope they keep going as long as the tabloids do.
