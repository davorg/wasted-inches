Much consternation amongst the tabloids this morning as someone from the
Lottery has let it slip that the odds are against you actually winning any
money. Well, what a surprise. It’s not called the Stupidity Tax for nothing
you know.

commentary:
Ten years ago, the National Lottery wasn’t new, but it was still interesting
enough for the tabloids to run stories about it. These days it doesn’t get a
mention except for the rare occasions when someone wins a rollover.
