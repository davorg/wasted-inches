text:
Britney’s recently dumped boyfriend, the completely unknown pop singer Justin
Timberlake, has said that, contrary to her claims, Britney is no longer a
virgin. And says “I should know”. Why would anyone care about this? Will hoards
of pre-pubescent girls stop buying Miss Spears’ records because she’s known
the pleasures of the flesh? We can only hope.

commentary:
It’s strange to remember how obsessed with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears">Britney Spears</a> the
media was ten years ago. These days she is almost completely ignored. And
remember how she used to claim that she was still a virgin? Of course, now
she has two or three children. And that “completely unknown”
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Timberlake">pop singer</a> is
now probably more famous than she is.
