Obviously vitally important stuff here people, as it’s all over the front page
of today’s <em>Soaraway Sun</em>. Apparently Posh (hah! have you heard her
speak?) and Becks are spending a quarter of a million on a party for the
England football team. Aren’t you glad you’re not invited? Imagine how bored
you’d get at a party where all the guests were either footballers or Spice
Girls.

commentary:
Football (in particular the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup">World Cup</a>) was going

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beckhams">The Beckhams</a> are still
standard tabloid fodder. And the tabloids’ coverage of the England World Cup
team gets more offensively jingoistic every time the competition comes around.
Of course, the other four
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice_Girls">Spice Girls</a> have largely
been forgotten.
