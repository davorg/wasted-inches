Two tabloids have attempted to cash in on the story of the two missing
schoolgirls by offering rewards for information this morning. The
<em>Soaraway Sun</em> offers £150,000 (and they’re giving away a free poster
so you know they’ve got to be serious!) The <em>Express</em> have trumped
them however, by offering the ridiculous sum of £1,000,000. Of course the
Express offer is all funded out of pornography, so you might feel a little
uncomfortable accepting the money.

commentary:
This is the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soham_murders">Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman</a>
story. At this point the girls were just missing. It wasn’t until 17th August
that their bodies were found. Ian Huntley and Maxine Carr were arrested soon
afterwards. I can’t see any evidence that the Sun or Express reader paid out
any money on these offers. Or that the Sun’s poster achieved anything useful
at all. Terrible things like this still happen – as I write this Stuart Hazell
has
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19221851">just been charged</a>
with the murder of Tia Sharp – and tabloids still overreact like this. I don’t
remember any more appeals for information that have been backed with tabloid’s
own money though.
