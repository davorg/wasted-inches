Now I’m not saying for a second that this isn’t news, but I really don’t like
the way the tabloids are reporting it. They all have headlines like “Millie –
Body Found”. Only by reading the details do you discover that a body has been
found that just <em>might</em> be Millie’s. And a couple of hours later the
police announce that it definitely <em>isn’t</em> Millie and the papers all
end up looking very stupid. Bet we don’t see a follow-up on tomorrow’s front
pages tho’.

commentary:
And now we get to the serious stuff. This is all about the tabloid’s desperate
need to sell as many papers as possible and the fact that they don’t really
care whether or not what they print is true. This story had been shown to be
false by the middle of the morning. But the following day there was no sign of
a correction or an apology. Sometimes it seems that the tabloids really believe
that their readers don’t remember what the paper wrote the previous day.
