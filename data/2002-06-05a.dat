We know that the Queen’s Golden Jubilee is important and we certainly wouldn’t
suggest for a moment that it’s not news. But does there need to be
<em>quite</em> so much coverage. On every front page. For four days.

commentary:
Seems like only yesterday that the tabloids were full of Jubilee nonsense.
Oh wait, it was. If anything the coverage of the Diamond Jubilee is even more
incessant than it was for the Golden Jubilee. So this story could easily be
reused word for word today.
