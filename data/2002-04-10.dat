By “Era”, I mean the last ten days or so when the tabloids have had nothing but
the Queen Mother on their front pages. Now that she’s been buried, perhaps we
can get back to the usual nonsense.

commentary:
TV stations had learned their lessons from Diana’s death five years earlier and
had drastically scaled down their original plans for dealing with the Queen
Mother’s death. Many of the tabloids still assumed we lived in the 1930s and
had published wall to wall coverage of every detail of the mourning period and
the funeral. Once the funeral had taken place they went back to normal.
