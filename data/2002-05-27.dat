The third series of Big Brother started over the weekend. This is a godsend for
lazy tabloid journalists. All they have to do is sit watching E4 all day and
they can print stories about a group of complete nobodies who the public have
suddenly become completely interested in. It’s interesting to compare the
different approaches that different tabloids take – the Star and the Sport
will just be printing as many nude pictures of the women in the house as they
can find, and on the other hand, the Mirror has declared itself the
“anti-Big Brother” paper and fills it’s pages with stories of how dire the
contestants are. Here at “Wasted Inches” we love Big Brother, but we really
can’t see how it should be front page news. Every day. For the next nine weeks.

commentary:
This seems dated now. It’s hard to believe that
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_%28UK%29">Big Brother</a>
was ever that popular. It’s been five years since anyone really took any notice
of it. Channel Four attempted to put the show out of its misery a couple of
years ago, but Channel Five picked it up and has been running it into the
ground ever since. As this story says, ten years ago there would be Big Brother
stories on the front page of just about every tabloid for the duration of the
show. Last summer I don’t remember seeing a single front page story. And I’m
embarrassed that I admitted to loving Big Brother. The interest soon wore off.
I don’t think I’ve watched an episode since Big Brother 7 in 2006.
