Deep in the Australian jungle (well not that deep as a 5-star hotel is only 5
minutes walk away) eight British C-list celebrities have been camping for two
weeks. It's been great TV, but it's certainly not news. However the tabloids
have all had it on their front pages every day. Today they were full of the
story of how Tara Palmer-Tomkinson (who is she anyway, and why is she famous?)
tried seducing Darren Day (the 'popular' singer) by grabbing his hand and
putting it in her pants (whilst she was wearing them). And the tabloid editors
think this is important enough to go on the front page. On a day when car
bombs had been exploding in Kabul.

commentary:
Ten years on, "I'm A Celebrityâ€¦" is still running. And the tabloids still run
stories about it in preference to real news. It has, however, moved to later
in the year so the 2012 series hasn't started yet. I have no idea whether
Palmer-Tomkinson and Day's relationship ever took off (and I'm confident that
you don't care). NATO troops are still on the streets of Kabul.
