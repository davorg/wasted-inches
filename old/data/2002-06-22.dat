Only one story on the front page of all the tabloids today. England losing to
Brazil in the World Cup. Oh well. Can we go back to normal now please? It's
only a game.

commentary:
SoÂ ten years ago England dropped out of the World Cup and the tabloids
portrayed it as a national tragedy. What do you think the front pages will
look like when England get knocked out of the current football competition?
