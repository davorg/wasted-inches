Now this is a perfect example of exactly what is wrong with tabloid journalism
in the UK. A third-rate has-been has a TV show to promote so she's suddenly
seen around town with a man less than half her age. The tabloids then print
this on their front pages. In what possible world could this be considered
news?

This is nothing more than a press release and it has no place in a newspaper.

commentary:
If there's one entry in the whole of Wasted Inches that I'm slightly contrite
about then it's this one. I mean, yes, of course it's appalling that people
engineer photo opportunities in order promote TV shows. But I'm a little
ashamed of describing
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lulu_%28singer%29">Lulu</a> as a
“third-rate has-been”. She's awesome, of course. I must have been feeling
particularly cynical that day.
