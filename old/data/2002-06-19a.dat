England won their game and are thru to the next round of the World Cup.
Predictably this was all over the tabloid front pages. We  understand that
they should be reporting it, but should they really make it sound like
there's a war on?

The <em>Mirror</em> was particularly objectionable with its jingoistic
knocking of the Argentinian team.

commentary:
I remember this being ludicrous. It was twenty years after the Falklands War
and yet the tabloids covered this story as if the war was still going on. And
ten years on I can't say that this has got any better. The tabloids still
treat Argentina as though it's an enemy nation. It's just like the way the
Germans were portrayed as I was growing up in the 60s and 70s.
