It must be a good headline as both the <em>Sun</em> and the <em>Mirror</em>
came up with it independently. The story is, of course, the birth of a second
son to a bad singer and a sportsman. The bit that apparently makes this news
(tho' we strongly suspect it would have made the front pages even if he'd
been called "Fred") is that they've chosen the name "Romeo". And, according
to the tabloids, this has confused the fans. It also gives the tabloid hacks
a chance to show off their education by paraphrasing Shakespeare. With the
Earth Summit going on in South Africa and the US once again rattling its
sabre at Iraq, it's difficult to see this as the most important news of the
day, but then we don't run the tabloids. Here at <em>Wasted Inches</em> we
hanker for the days when this would have been a small announcement in the
personal columns of <em>The Times</em>.

commentary:
The Beckhams had one more child and named him "Cruz". Their skills at choosing
names led comedian Stuart Francis to comment "You know who really gives kids
a bad name? Posh and Becks." TV viewers judged this to be the
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19338273">funniest joke</a>
at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2012.
