More spectacularly dishonest journalism on the front page of today's Sport.
There's a photo of one of the women from Big Brother that looks like she's
topless. The headline isÂ spread across her breasts so you can't see them.
Inside the story says something like "we still haven't got any topless photos
of the Big Brother women, but there are some great fakes on the internet
already". Why does anyone buy that paper?

Well, nobody does buy that paper now. One of the few improvements in the
tabloid industry over the last ten years is the death of the Sport in 2011.
No-one misses it one bit.
