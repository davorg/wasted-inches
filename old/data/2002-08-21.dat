What the <em>Sun</em> headline writers are trying to say (in their stumbling,
and very nearly English, way) is that Ian Huntley, the man charged with the
murders of schoolgirls Holly and Jessica, won't be able to convince the doctors
at Rampton that he is mentally ill and thereby escape trial. As always, the
<em>Sun</em> doesn't let inconvenient facts get in the way of a good story.
In this case they ignore the fact that either Huntley <em>is</em> mentally
ill, in which case no conning will be required, or he isn't, in which case he
has already managed to con some doctors in order to be sent to Rampton in the
first place. Logic was never the <em>Sun</em>‘s strong point.

commentary:
It turned out that Huntley wasn't considered mentally ill. He was convicted
of the murder of the two girls and is currently ten years into a life sentence.
He will not be released until he has served at least forty years.
