The whole tabloid world has gone mad over the disappearance of the two young
girls Holly and Jessica. For two weeks now the story has dominated the
headlines. It's obviously an important story, but do we really need to be
quite so Liverpudlian about it? Today there's no new news, but it still has
to be on the front pages so the tabloid reporters have digging around in the
past of the two people who are being questioned. They've discovered that the
chap's ex-wife got married to his brother. Obviously that's really important
news as it shows us exactly what kind of family he comes from. The kind that
can oh-so-easily produce paedophiles and child-killers. Or maybe it's not
news at all and is just another example of unwarranted intrusion into people's
private lives.

commentary:
This still happens and still really annoys rational people. I can't remember
who the subjects of this story are, but I'm pretty sure they aren't Ian
Huntley and Maxine Carr â€“ so that's two people who are having their past
exposed to the Sun's readership for no good reason.
