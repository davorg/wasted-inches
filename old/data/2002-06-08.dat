Only one story on the front page of every tabloid today. In fact it's on the
front page of <em>every</em> paper. England won a football match yesterday.
Apparently it's also important to note that it was Argentina that they beat.
This gives the tabloids an excuse to report it as tho' it was the Malvinas
Crisis of 1982 all over again. From the tone of the papers you could easily
think that they had won the World Cup, but our investigations reveal that it
was a relativelyÂ unimportant match and we still have three weeks of this
nonsense to go.

commentary:
This was probably the World Cup, wasn't it? I remember there being a World Cup
that summer. It was great as it was held in a part of the world that mean that
the games were all played first thing in the morning. This meant that on the
days that England played the tubes, trains and buses were all deserted and
travelling to work was a pleasure. Shame England didn't play more games.
