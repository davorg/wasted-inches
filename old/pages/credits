<h2>Who are you?</h2>

Well we’d like to portray ourselves as a shadowy group of media
anarchists, but those of you inclined to do a bit of digging
around in DNS records won’t find it too difficult to work out
who we are.

<h2>Why are you doing this?</h2>

Well we’re the first to admit that it’s not big and it’s not
clever, but we really thought it was about time that someone
pointed out the stupidity of having a popular media that largely
ignores real news and feeds its readers with a nonstop diet of
pointless trivia.

We really can’t understand why people would want to read about
the sex lives of soap stars when there is important stuff going
on in the world. The population can’t really be that stupid. Can
it?

<h2>Where do you get your information from</h2>

From looking at the headlines of the British tabloid press when we
go in to buy our quality papers. It’s only ever the front pages that
we look at so we never need to actually defile ourselves by buying
the papers.

<h2>I think you’re just jealous that these people are more successful than you?</h2>

Then you’re absolutely right!
