# Wasted Inches

This is the code and content for the
[Wasted Inches](https://wasted.dave.org.uk/) blog. This is a blog I wrote
for a few months back in 2002 when I was obsessed with how terrible the
British tabloid press was. The idea was that each day I'd take a headline
that I'd seen on one of the newspapers and explain (wittily and sarcastically)
exactly just how rubbish the story was. I'll leave it to you to decide how
successful I was.

Originally it was run on [Movable Type](https://movabletype.org/) (back when
it was open source software) and it may have passed through a
[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) incarnation before reaching its current
version, which is a static site, hosted on
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I keep it running for two reasons. Firstly, I still quite like some of the
jokes. And, secondly, it's a useful test bed for a static sitebuilder
system I've written called [Aphra](https://aphra.perlhacks.com/).

The code is all on [GitHub](https://github.com/davorg/wasted-inches).
