## Who are you?

Well we&#8217;d like to portray ourselves as a shadowy group of media
anarchists, but those of you inclined to do a bit of digging around in DNS
records won&#8217;t find it too difficult to work out who we are.

## Why are you doing this?

Well we&#8217;re the first to admit that it&#8217;s not big and
it&#8217;s not clever, but we really thought it was about time that someone
pointed out the stupidity of having a popular media that largely ignores real
news and feeds its readers with a nonstop diet of pointless trivia.

We really can&#8217;t understand why people would want to read about the sex
lives of soap stars when there is important stuff going on in the world. The
population can&#8217;t really be that stupid. Can it?

## Where do you get your information from

From looking at the headlines of the British tabloid press when we go in to
buy our quality papers. It&#8217;s only ever the front pages that we look at
so we never need to actually defile ourselves by buying the papers.

## I think you&#8217;re just jealous that these people are more successful than you?

Then you&#8217;re absolutely right!
